Swiss-Beer-Map: Mapping the breweries of Switzerland
----------------------------------------------------

A map of Swiss breweries, hosted on http://www.ralphstraumann.ch/projects/swiss-beers. 

###Tech stack
* [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) 
* a Google Spreadsheet, to which people can contribute using a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1L3_8pJ3zrXg7faPyVTSzP_MhXPMgcYYiNF82852msV8/viewform)
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) [Google Spreadsheet plugin](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/google-docs/#geocoding) for simple [MapQuest](http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/dev-services/geocoding-ws)-based geocoding of addresses
* [Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) for comfortably polling data from said Google Spreadsheet
* a handful of Leaflet-plugins

###Get involved
I'm happy to collaborate on Beer Maps for e.g. the whole of Europe or DE-AT-CH, though these might need a more performant, scalable backend/data storage.
